            She completed her undergraduate degree in Comparative Literature with Film Studies at King’s College London in 2017 with a focus on cross-media perspectives in art. Her thesis titled “So the world will read you like the poem you want to be” examined notions of intentionality and a sensory sentiment across space, sight and sound in the work of the Beat Poets and drew inspiration from 2016's Beat Generation exhibition in the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris.

            In 2019 she graduated from Central Saint Martins with an MA in Culture, Criticism and Curation. Aside from live projects with the CSM Museum & Study Collection as well as vFd Dalston she focused her research on music. Her postgraduate thesis titled “Fuckified” explored the artistry and narrative potential in heavily manipulated sound in contemporary popular music - with case studies by Bon Iver and EDEN. It was presented in December 2018 at Making Cultural Space  - a collaborative symposium investigating when, where and how spaces are created with and for culture. This event was hosted by MA CCC, CSM and CCA, RCA.

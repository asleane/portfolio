    Josephine's presentation was part of London Fashion Week 2019 and took place on 15 February in the gallery spaces of New Art Projects London in collaboration with vFd and alongside the VFD10 - Punish The Streets exhibition. This was also the first show in London that featured an all-trans cast, making history and marking an important milestone for trans-inclusivity.

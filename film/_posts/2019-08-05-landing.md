Filmmaking as research:

Schiller Schiller premiered at the Liverpool Biennial 'Beautiful World, Where Are You?' on October 4, 2018 in the Exhibition Research Lab of the Liverpool John Moores University as part of an evening of film screenings and discussion exploring artistic and political engagements of the biennial. 

Influenced by Bruce Conner's Crossroads this short film works with archival footage of the nuclear tests in Bikini Atoll in 1946, suspending and bending the meaning of those images through sound. Music and voiceovers employ both an excerpt from Schiller's 9th letter on The Aesthetic Education of Man and a cover of Fatboy Slim's popular track Praise You. As a high and low culture dichotomy, the film toys with the implications and facets found in words and visuals.

Made in collaboration with Nigel Nunes.

    <p>After I published the Conferences.digital macOS app, I was approached by a number of people asking if and whether an iOS version was available. Although I had designed the app thinking that the demand for a macOS app was greater than for an iOS app, I saw the opportunity to develop this project further and also work collaboratively with a few developers that reached out to me following the macOS version.</p>

<p>I am currently in the progress of writing the iOS version and am excited for the future of this project - especially working with the fantastic people I have met through it.</p>

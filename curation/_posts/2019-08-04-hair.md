    The exhibition Hair Matters marked a collaboration between vFd and Central Saint Martins. Through public art interventions around Dalston, it examined the social and cultural symbolism of hair, employing a queer perspective. The show featured six young, queer artists including Travis Alabanza, Sad√© Mico and Alex Noble, their work ranging from photo manipulations and textiles to ephemera and audio material.

    Located at New Art Projects London, this exhibition was a celebration of a decade of vFd in Dalston and highlighted the influences that flow between club culture, art and fashion. Participating artists such as Dr Noki, Maryam Eiser, John Lee Bird and Christeene created new works including painting, drawing and installation. Alongside, the show featured film footage, music videos, photographs and original artwork from the clubâ€™s extensive archive.

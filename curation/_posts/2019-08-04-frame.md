    In the form of a window display in the Lethaby Gallery, the exhibition explored the interdisciplinary approach in art education and practice at the Central School of Arts and Crafts by reappropriating formats used by Richard Hamilton in his 2014 ICA show. Additionally, a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/seekingfreedomfromwithintheframe/tracks">podcast</a> series was produced alongside the show.
